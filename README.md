**Real-World, Multi-User Data Centre Workload Simulation for Server Testing**

A scalable, open-source framework for simulating realistic multi-user login traffic against a server — built to test how authentication systems behave under ramp-up, peak, sustained, and cooldown conditions, from hundreds to millions of users.

## What this is

Most server load tests send flat, constant traffic — but real production traffic ramps up, spikes, sustains, and cools down, often through multiple interfaces at once, with different user types competing for the same server resources.

This framework reproduces that realism around a login/authentication system — one of the most concurrency-sensitive parts of any application. It simulates three interface types (web, mobile, API), each with light and heavy user variants, generating realistic session lifecycles alongside sustained machine traffic. This creates genuine cross-interface contention and exposes defects that flat-load tests miss entirely.

## Team and responsibilities

| Member | Role | Owns |
|---|---|---|
| Member 1 | App developer | `app/main.py` — FastAPI endpoints |
| Member 2 | App developer | `app/main.py` — auth logic, session tokens |
| Member 3 | Simulation developer | `simulation/` — Locust users, loadshapes, run_test.py, YAML profiles |
| Member 4 | Infrastructure | `infra/` — Docker Compose, Prometheus config, crash watchdog |
| Member 5 | Monitoring | `monitoring/` — Grafana dashboards, Node Exporter, alerts |
| Member 6 | Analysis and reporting | `analysis/` — analyse.py, PDF report, SLA verdict, charts |

---

## Prerequisites

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (Windows/Mac) or Docker Engine (Linux)
- Python 3.11+
- Git
- 8GB RAM minimum, 16GB recommended (six containers run simultaneously)

---

## Quick start

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/subhasreelk/datacenter-sim.git
cd datacenter-sim
```

### 2. Set up environment variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env if needed — defaults work for local development
```

### 3. Install Python dependencies

```bash
pip install -r app/requirements.txt
pip install -r simulation/requirements.txt
```

### 4. Start the full stack

```bash
cd infra
docker-compose up --build
```

This starts all six services on one Docker network:
- FastAPI login server
- Locust master + workers
- Prometheus + Node Exporter
- Grafana

### 5. Open the dashboards

| Service | URL |
|---|---|
| FastAPI server | http://localhost:8000 |
| Locust UI | http://localhost:8089 |
| Prometheus | http://localhost:9090 |
| Grafana | http://localhost:3000 |

## Workload profiles

All test parameters live in a single YAML file. Changing one file changes the entire test — no code touched.

```yaml
# workload_profiles/normal_day.yaml

target_users: 500
spawn_rate: 10
duration: 300

phases:
  ramp_up: 60        # seconds — users gradually increase
  peak: 120          # seconds — full concurrency
  steady_state: 90   # seconds — sustained load
  cooldown: 30       # seconds — users wind down

user_mix:
  web: 0.50
  mobile: 0.35
  api: 0.15

sla:
  p95_login_ms: 500
  error_rate: 0.01
  cpu_percent: 80
  memory_percent: 90
```

Two profiles are included out of the box:

| Profile | Pattern | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| `normal_day.yaml` | Steady baseline with gradual ramp | Establishing a healthy baseline |
| `flash_event.yaml` | Sudden spike, short sharp peak | Simulating a sale, event, or viral moment |

---

## Simulated user types

Three interface types are simulated, each split into weighted light and heavy variants:

| User type | Weight | Light variant | Heavy variant |
|---|---|---|---|
| WebUser | 50% | 80% — login → /me → logout (single pass) | 20% — login → loop(/me + /profile/update) → logout |
| MobileUser | 35% | 60% — login → /me once | 40% — login → poll /me repeatedly (background sync) |
| APIUser | 15% | 30% — login once → occasional /api/data | 70% — login once → sustained /api/data calls |

The heavy APIUser is the primary source of cross-interface contention — it competes with web and mobile traffic for the same CPU and session store resources.

---

## Server endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Used by | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | /login | All users | Authenticate, issue session token |
| POST | /logout | Web users | End session, invalidate token |
| GET | /me | Web + Mobile | Get current user profile |
| POST | /profile/update | Mobile (heavy), Web (heavy) | Update profile — write-heavy |
| GET | /api/data | API users | Sustained machine traffic |
| GET | /health | Monitoring | Liveness check |
| GET | /metrics | Prometheus | Request count, latency histograms |

---

## Running tests

Always run the baseline first, then the spike, so the analysis can compare both runs:

```bash
# Run steady baseline
python simulation/run_test.py --profile workload_profiles/normal_day.yaml

# Run flash event spike
python simulation/run_test.py --profile workload_profiles/flash_event.yaml
```

### Scale up workers for higher user counts

```bash
docker-compose up --scale locust-worker=4
```

No code changes needed — just add workers.

---

## Monitoring

While a test runs, open Grafana at http://localhost:3000 (login `admin` / `admin`).
The **Datacenter Sim → Load Test** dashboard is auto-provisioned and shows:

- Requests per second
- p95 login latency (SLA line at 500ms)
- Error rate (SLA line at 1%)
- CPU utilisation (SLA line at 80%)
- Memory utilisation
- Active sessions and login success/failure rates

Prometheus raw metrics are available at http://localhost:9090.

---

## Crash logging

Container logs and Prometheus metrics are persisted via Docker volume mounts — they survive container crashes and restarts.

Log locations on the host machine:

```
logs/fastapi/server.log     ← FastAPI app logs (full stack traces)
logs/crash_<timestamp>.txt  ← Crash snapshot captured by watchdog
data/prometheus/            ← Prometheus time-series data
```

Run the crash watchdog alongside your test to automatically capture a full snapshot the moment the server goes down:

```bash
python monitor/crash_watch.py &
python simulation/run_test.py --profile workload_profiles/flash_event.yaml
```

---

## Generating the report

After one or both test runs complete:

```bash
python analysis/analyse.py --run results/latest.csv
```

Output is saved to `analysis/reports/` as a PDF containing:

- Latency and throughput charts over time
- Per-phase breakdown (ramp-up, peak, steady-state, cooldown)
- Bottleneck identification (CPU, memory, thread pool, DB connections)
- SLA pass/fail verdict per metric
- Crash log summary if any errors were detected

---

## Scalability

Simulating millions of users is achieved architecturally, not by literally running a million-user test on a laptop:

- **Config-driven scale** — change `target_users` in the YAML, nothing else changes
- **Locust distributed mode** — one master coordinates many worker nodes generating load independently
- **Horizontal scaling** — `docker-compose up --scale locust-worker=N` adds capacity in one command
- **Bottleneck identification** — the report identifies the exact ceiling and what to fix to go higher
- **Cloud-ready** — the same `docker-compose up` command works on any cloud VM (AWS EC2, Azure, GCP) for true large-scale runs

---

## SLA thresholds

Default thresholds (configurable per profile in the YAML):

| Metric | Default threshold |
|---|---|
| p95 login latency | < 500ms |
| Error rate | < 1% |
| CPU utilisation | < 80% |
| Memory utilisation | < 90% |

---

## Contributing

### Branch naming

```
feature/<your-name>-<short-description>
e.g. feature/member3-locustfile
     feature/member5-grafana-dashboard
```

### Workflow

1. Never push directly to `main`
2. Create a branch for your feature or fix
3. Open a pull request when your work is ready
4. At least one other team member reviews before merge
5. Use `develop` branch for integration testing — merge to `main` only when the full stack works end to end

### Integration checkpoints

Three points where the whole team must sync before moving on:

| Checkpoint | Condition |
|---|---|
| 1 | FastAPI server is running locally and Locust can hit it successfully |
| 2 | `docker-compose up --build` starts all six services and Prometheus is scraping metrics |
| 3 | A full end-to-end test run produces a Locust CSV and `analyse.py` generates a PDF |
